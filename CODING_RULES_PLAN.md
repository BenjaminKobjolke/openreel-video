# Common Rules (All Languages)

These rules apply to all projects, regardless of language. Language-specific rules live in the
corresponding `*_RULES.md` files.

---

## Use Objects for Related Values

When multiple related values must be passed between classes or methods, bundle them into a
dedicated object (e.g., DTO/Settings/Config) instead of passing many parameters. This improves
readability, reduces call-site churn, and makes changes safer.

---

## No Bag-of-Keys Returns at Module Boundaries

When a public method on a manager/repository/service returns data that crosses a module
boundary, the return type must be a typed object (DTO, value object, or domain model) — never
a raw associative array indexed by string keys. Plain `array` returns silently swallow shape
bugs: a missing key reads as `null`, a list-vs-single mix-up reads as "no data", and renames
go undetected by static analysis.

- **Anti-pattern.** `getSettingsValue(...)` returns `array|null`; callers do `$result['value']`,
  `$result['type']`. A consumer mis-indexes `$result[0]['value']` after a refactor; nothing
  flags the change. The function silently returns `null` and downstream defaults take over.
- **Correct pattern.** Return a class — `getSettingsElement(...): ?SettingsElement`. The class
  exposes `getValue()`, `getType()`, `exists()`. Typed, autocompleted, statically checked;
  renames propagate via the IDE.
- **Lists vs single must be obvious from the type and the name.** `getThing(): ?Thing`
  (zero or one) vs `getThings(): ThingList` or `iterable<Thing>`. Never overload the same
  return type to mean both.
- **Distinguish absent from empty.** `null` from a lookup means "not found"; an empty
  collection means "found, but had nothing". A typed return makes this contract explicit;
  a bag-of-keys array hides it.
- **JSON-decoded blobs are arrays too.** The rule applies equally to `json_decode($column, true)`
  results that cross a module boundary — wrap them in a value object before they leave the
  layer that owns the schema.
- **Internal helpers may stay arrays.** This rule targets *public* API on managers and the
  boundary where a domain abstraction starts. Pure-private array juggling inside a single
  method is fine.

---

## Reuse Existing Models Before Inventing Array Shapes

Before designing a new return type or DTO, search the codebase for an existing domain class
that already owns the same data. Most "should this be a DTO?" decisions are actually
"is there already a `Contest` / `User` / `Order` class that should absorb this method?"

- Grep for the table name, the primary key, and the most distinctive column.
- If a model already exists with a constructor that accepts the row shape, use it — don't
  invent a parallel array shape that mirrors the same columns.
- Adding a `getXxxObject()` alongside a legacy `getXxxData()` is acceptable as a migration
  step; keep both only until consumers are migrated, then delete the array-returning version.

---

## Tests Pin the Shape Before the Refactor

When converting a bag-of-keys return to a typed object, write a **characterization test
first** that locks the current behavior using the existing API, run it green against the
unrefactored code, and then refactor. The same test (or a renamed-but-equivalent one) must
remain green afterward.

This converts "I think the new object preserves behavior" into "the test proves it." Pair
with the "Test-Driven Development" rule below — characterization tests are TDD applied to
refactors instead of new features.

---

## Test-Driven Development for Features and Bug Fixes

Follow TDD when implementing features or fixing bugs:

1. Write tests first
2. Run the tests and confirm they fail
3. Implement the change or fix
4. Run the tests again and confirm they pass

---

## Integration Tests

Every project must include integration tests in addition to unit tests. Integration tests verify that
components work correctly together and catch issues that unit tests alone cannot detect.

---

## Prefer Type-Safe Values

Use strong, explicit types instead of loosely typed or stringly typed values (e.g., typed DTOs,
enums, generics, typed settings). This ensures mistakes are caught at compile time or by tests
early in development.

---

## String Constants

Centralize string constants in a dedicated module/class. Do not scatter raw strings across
the codebase. Use language-appropriate patterns for constants and reuse them consistently.

---

## Reusable Tooling

Before building project-specific infrastructure scripts (audits, codemods,
build helpers, lint checks, etc.) for a project, check the matching
language's `*_setup_files/` folder under this `coding-rules` repo for an
existing equivalent. If found, copy or reference it. If not:

1. Build the script in the project and prove it on real data.
2. Copy the script into the right `*_setup_files/tools/` folder.
3. Document it in that language's `*_RULES.md` so the next project picks
   it up automatically.

This keeps cross-project tooling consistent and prevents the same script
from being re-invented in every new project.

---

## New Projects Start From a Template
<!-- steps: plan -->

Before creating a new project (an API, an app, a tool — anything that gets its own folder),
ask the user whether a template project exists for that kind of project. Never scaffold from
scratch without asking.

- Run `/coding-rules:new-project`: it suggests the template remembered for that project type
  in `~/.coding-rules/settings.json`, asks, and remembers a newly chosen template for next time.
- A remembered template is a suggestion — still ask, the user may want another one or none.

---

## README.md is Mandatory

Every project must have a `README.md` file in the root directory. It should include:

- Project name and description
- Installation/setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Dependencies and requirements

---

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Avoid code duplication. If the same logic appears in multiple places, extract it into a
reusable function, class, module, or utility.

- Duplicate code is harder to maintain and leads to bugs
- Extract shared logic into helpers or base abstractions
- Use constants for repeated values

---

## Derive, Don't Duplicate — One Value Owns the Derivation

When one value strictly determines another, pass only the determinant and derive the rest —
never thread both side-by-side through call sites, constructors, and events. Two co-varying
parameters are a functional dependency in disguise; passing both lets them drift into illegal
combinations.

- **Anti-pattern.** `createLog(ActionCategory $cat, ActionType $type)` threaded through ~10
  sites. Nothing stops a caller passing `category: email, type: lead.created`.
- **Correct pattern.** The richer type owns the relationship: `ActionType::category()` returns
  its `ActionCategory` via a single exhaustive `match`. Call sites pass only `ActionType`;
  category is always derived, so a mismatch is unconstructable.
- **Apply when** one value *determines* the other (a true functional dependency).
- **Don't apply when** the relationship is many-to-many or genuinely independent — forcing a
  derivation that doesn't exist couples things that should stay separate.
- **Keep derivation cheap and pure** — a getter/match, no DB or IO behind a call that looks free.
- **Keep the mapping exhaustive** (enum + exhaustive match) so a new case cannot silently skip
  its derived value.

This is Single Source of Truth applied to parameters, and a form of "make illegal states
unrepresentable." Pairs with "Prefer Type-Safe Values" and "Self-Describing Classes".

---

## Keep It Simple (KISS)

Prefer the simplest solution that actually works. Complicated logic for a simple result must be
kept to a minimum — a future maintainer (or you, at 3am) has to understand it.

- **YAGNI.** Don't build for a need that isn't here yet: no interface with a single
  implementation, no factory for one product, no config for a value that never changes.
- **Boring over clever.** Clever is what someone decodes later. The obvious solution wins.
- **Deletion over addition.** The shortest working change is usually the right one.
- Pairs with "Don't Repeat Yourself" and "No God Classes" — simplicity is what those rules
  are protecting.

---

## Confirm Dependency Versions

Before adding any new package or library, confirm the version with the user to ensure we use
up-to-date dependencies.

- Do not assume which version to use
- Ask the user to verify the latest stable version
- Avoid outdated packages that may have security vulnerabilities or missing features

---

## Error Handling & Logging Strategy

Every project must have a centralized error handler rather than ad-hoc try/catch blocks scattered
throughout the codebase.

- Use structured logging (not `print`/`console.log`/`echo`)
- Log at appropriate levels: debug, info, warning, error
- Include context in log messages (module name, operation, relevant IDs)

---

## Centralized Logger — Single Off Switch

Route all logging through one dedicated logger class/module. Never call the language's
built-in output directly for logging (`print`, `console.log`, `echo`, `Debug.Log`,
`System.out`). Code calls the project logger; the project logger wraps the underlying sink.

- **One toggle.** Because every log goes through one place, logging can be turned off,
  level-filtered, or redirected (file, console, remote) from a single config flag — without
  touching call sites. Example: a `logEnabled` / `logLevel` setting the logger checks once.
- **Levels live in the logger.** Callers pass a level (debug/info/warning/error); the logger
  decides what is emitted based on central config. Callers never branch on "should I log?".
- **Wrap, don't scatter.** Built-in calls (`print`, framework loggers, `Debug.Log`) appear
  in exactly one file — the logger implementation. Everywhere else imports the logger.
- **Language specifics** still apply (e.g. Unity `[Conditional]` stripping, Flutter `logger`
  package, Python `logging`) — but they are configured inside the central logger, not at
  call sites.

The logger's name is fixed per language so it is the same known type in every project (see each
`*_RULES.md` for details):

| Language      | Class / export     | File                |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Python        | `AppLogger`        | `app_logger.py`     |
| PHP           | `Logger`           | `Logger.php`        |
| Dart/Flutter  | `AppLogger`        | `app_logger.dart`   |
| Kotlin        | `AppLogger`        | `AppLogger.kt`      |
| C# (plain)    | `AppLogger`        | `AppLogger.cs`      |
| C++           | `AppLogger`        | `AppLogger.h` / `AppLogger.cpp` |
| Unity C#      | `GameLog` (static) | `GameLog.cs`        |
| Svelte/JS/TS  | `logger` (export)  | `logger.ts`         |
| Arduino       | `Log`              | `Log.h` / `Log.cpp` |

---

## Input Validation at Boundaries

Always validate data at system boundaries — API inputs, user input, file uploads, external service
responses.

- Never trust external data; validate before processing
- Use language-appropriate validation libraries (e.g., Pydantic, Zod, FluentValidation)
- Fail fast with clear error messages when validation fails

---

## API Clients: the API Sorts, Filters and Pages (BINDING)

Applies to every project that reads data from an API — app, SPA, desktop tool, script.

- **Show what the API returns, in the order it returns it.** Never download a whole collection
  to sort, filter, search, count, group or join it locally.
- **Read lists page by page.** Send the page size and position and load the next page when the
  user scrolls or asks for more. Never loop over all pages to rebuild the full list on start or
  on refresh.
- **A new order, filter or search is a new request** with that parameter, starting at the first
  page. Reordering the rows already held is wrong as soon as the list is paged: the client holds
  one page, not the list.
- **Do not download again what you already hold.** After a create, update or delete use the row
  the response returned, or re-request the visible page — not the whole collection.
- **A missing parameter is API work.** When an API you own lacks the sort, filter, search,
  paging or count a screen needs, request it from the API project (linked todo or
  `/feedback:write`) and plan against that. "The list is small or unpaged today, so the client
  can do it" is not a reason. For a third-party API that cannot change, use the paging and
  sorting it offers and mark any remaining local work with a comment naming the missing
  capability.

The server half is `project_type/REST_API.md` -> "List Endpoints: Paging, Sorting, Filtering".

---

## Shared Contract Repository for API and Clients (BINDING)

When two or more projects we own talk over the wire — an API plus an app, an API plus a desktop
app, or all three — keep their shared values in one contract repository. This does not apply to
third-party APIs.

- **Why:** each side keeps its own copy of every value that crosses the wire. When one side adds a
  value the other does not know, the other side can break (for example, the API added a todo type
  and the watcher rejected the whole todo list).
- **One separate repository** (`<system>-contract`) holds the contract: at minimum every shared
  enum in `enums.json`, shaped as `"<Name>": {"values": [sorted unique], "direction":
  "api_to_client" | "client_to_api", "description": "<where it appears>"}`, plus a `README.md`
  with the change rules and the list of consumers. Do not add version numbers; the submodule
  pointer is the version.
- **Every project includes it as a git submodule at `contract/`.** Pick up changes with
  `git submodule update --remote contract` and commit the pointer bump. Production code never
  reads `contract/`; it is test input only.
- **The API is the producer:** export the contract from its own constants (one map, one export
  script) and add a freshness test that fails when the committed file differs from the export.
- **Each client is a consumer:** test that every mapped enum matches the contract in its
  direction (`api_to_client` sets are equal so the client knows every value;
  `client_to_api` client values are a subset) and that every contract name is mapped.
- Both tests skip when `contract/` is not checked out.
- **Change order:** for an `api_to_client` value, update the contract, release clients that know
  it, then have the API emit it. For a `client_to_api` value, update the contract and API first,
  then have the client send it. To remove a value, stop it at the API, then remove it from the
  contract, then from clients. Never rename a value; renaming is an add plus a remove. Add a new
  shared enum to the contract in the same change that introduces it.
- Clients still tolerate an unknown value (skip the row; do not fail the whole response) as a
  last line of defence, not as permission to skip the order.
- **Setting it up** is work in each project: when one project of the system lacks the submodule
  or its test, request it there (linked todo or `/feedback:write`).

---

## Maximum File Length — 300 Lines

Split files when they exceed 300 lines to keep code navigable during fast iteration.

- Extract classes, functions, or components into separate modules
- Group related extractions logically (by domain, not by type)
- Exceptions: generated files, configuration files, test files with many similar cases

---

## Naming Conventions

Be consistent within a project. Follow these defaults unless the language or framework dictates
otherwise:

- Files: `snake_case` (or language convention, e.g., `PascalCase` for C# classes)
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/methods: language convention (`snake_case` for Python/PHP, `camelCase` for Dart/JS/C#)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Variables: language convention (`snake_case` for Python/PHP, `camelCase` for Dart/JS/C#)

---

## Comments Explain Why, Not What

Comment intent and non-obvious reasoning — not a restatement of the code. Good names carry the
*what*; comments carry the *why*.

- **Anti-pattern.** `i++ // increment i`. Redundant comments add noise and rot the moment the
  code changes.
- **Correct pattern.** Document *why* a workaround exists, why a non-obvious algorithm was
  chosen, or a constraint that isn't visible locally (`// API rejects batches > 500`).
- Prefer self-documenting code (clear names, small functions) over a comment that compensates
  for unclear code — see "Naming Conventions" and "Keep It Simple".
- Document the purpose of each module/class at its top.
- Keep comments in sync with the code; delete stale ones rather than letting them mislead.

---

## Security Baseline

Every project must follow these minimum security practices:

- Never commit secrets (`.env`, API keys, credentials, private keys)
- Escape output to prevent XSS/injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries or ORM-provided methods — never concatenate user input into queries
- Validate and sanitize all user input at system boundaries
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities

---

## No Hardcoded Environment Values

Never hardcode environment-specific values in code — filesystem paths, hostnames, IP addresses,
ports, base URLs. They differ across machines and environments and make code non-portable.

- **Anti-pattern.** `connect("192.168.1.50:5432")`, `open("C:\\Users\\bob\\data\\out.json")`.
- **Correct pattern.** Read them from the project's central config (the config class each
  `*_RULES.md` already mandates), with a committed `.example` template documenting every key.
- Distinct from the secrets rule above: this is about **portability** (runs anywhere), not
  secrecy. A non-secret hostname still belongs in config, not in code.

---

## No God Classes

A class that handles too many responsibilities becomes fragile, hard to test, and impossible to
reuse. Keep each class focused on a single purpose.

- **Warning signs**: more than 5 public methods, more than 4 constructor dependencies, or methods that span unrelated domains (e.g., a class that validates input, queries the database, and sends emails)
- Split by responsibility: extract collaborators (e.g., a `Validator`, a `Repository`, a `Notifier`) rather than piling logic into one class
- If you struggle to name the class without using "Manager", "Handler", "Service", or "Helper" as a catch-all, it likely does too much
- This complements the 300-line file rule — a short class can still be a god class if it owns too many concerns

---

## Self-Describing Classes

When behavior depends on which fields or properties a class has — such as search, serialization,
display, validation, or auditing — the class itself must declare those fields through a contract
(interface, abstract method, attribute/annotation, or introspection pattern). Never hardcode field
lists in consuming code.

- **Anti-pattern**: A search service contains a hardcoded list of fields to index for each entity;
  adding a new field requires updating every consumer manually
- **Correct pattern**: Each class implements a contract (e.g., `GetSearchableFields()`,
  `GetDisplayColumns()`) that returns its own relevant fields, so adding a field in one place
  automatically propagates everywhere
- This applies to any cross-cutting concern that operates over class fields: search, filtering,
  export, form generation, diffing, logging, etc.
- Combine with compile-time checks where the language supports them (e.g., sealed interfaces,
  exhaustive matching) to ensure new fields cannot be silently ignored

---

## Search Across Partial Words

When implementing user-facing search, split the query on whitespace and match every term as a
case-insensitive substring of the searchable text, regardless of term order. For example,
`release bat` should find `release_build.bat`. Preserve the project's existing searchable fields.

---

## Inject Collaborators, Don't Fold Dependencies In

Composition reuse comes in two shapes, and they differ sharply in how much coupling they add to
the reusing class. **Folding** a helper into a class (mixin, trait, multiple inheritance, copy-in
include) merges *all of the helper's own dependencies* into that class — reuse five such helpers
and every one of their imports is now the host's coupling. **Injecting** a collaborator adds a
single dependency: the collaborator, which is built once and shared as a hub.

Prefer injected collaborators. Reserve fold-in reuse for helpers that are stateless and carry no
dependencies of their own.

- **Anti-pattern**: A controller reuses five behavior mixins/traits; each brings its own service,
  DTO, and constant imports, so the controller transitively depends on a few dozen things and is
  hard to test in isolation.
- **Correct pattern**: Extract that behavior into a collaborator object injected via the
  constructor. The controller depends on the collaborator; the collaborator is reused across many
  controllers as a shared, well-tested hub.

### Inject services; never instantiate one inside a method

Constructing a service with `new` (or the language equivalent) inside a method hides the
dependency from the class's public contract and makes it impossible to substitute in a test. Pass
collaborators in through the constructor.

- **Anti-pattern**: A method does `helper = new EmailPreparer(); helper.prepare(...)`. Nothing in
  the class signature reveals the dependency, and no test can replace it.
- **Correct pattern**: Inject `EmailPreparer` once; the method calls the injected instance.

### Collapse config-callback swarms into one value object

When a base class pulls its configuration from the subclass through many small overridable getters
that the subclass fills in one-line-each, each getter is a separate touch-point and the wiring is
spread across dozens of methods. Bundle the related values into a single config object built once
and handed to the base (see **Use Objects for Related Values**). This also keeps such classes off
the wrong side of **No God Classes**.

- **Anti-pattern**: A subclass implements `getSendEndpoint()`, `getSendSuccessKey()`,
  `getSendFailureRedirect()`, and a dozen more one-line getters, each naming one constant.
- **Correct pattern**: The subclass builds one `SendConfig` value object once; the base reads its
  fields.

# Version
2

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# TypeScript Rules (Bun / Node)

See `COMMON_RULES.md` for rules that apply to all languages.

This file is the type layer for any TypeScript project. Runtime, layout, build,
and test conventions come from the paired runtime file:

- Bun CLI apps: `JAVASCRIPT_RULES.md` (all of it applies, with `.ts` file
  extensions).
- pnpm/Node workspaces: `typescript/PNPM_WORKSPACE.md` (do not apply
  `JAVASCRIPT_RULES.md`).
- Browser code bundled by another project type: that type's own section.

## tsconfig

Strict from day one:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "target": "ESNext",
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true
  }
}
```

`types` follows the runtime: `bun-types` for Bun, `node` for Node packages,
and `vite/client` for Vite browser apps. Never mix Node and DOM types in one
package.

Never weaken `strict` per-file. `// @ts-expect-error` needs a trailing reason
comment; `// @ts-ignore` is forbidden.

---

## No `any`

External data is `unknown`, never `any`. Narrow it with type guards or a
validation library before use. At module boundaries, typed DTOs/interfaces
replace the JS `normalizeXxx()` pattern — the type IS the contract, and the
compiler enforces what the JS normalizer only checks at runtime (see
COMMON_RULES "No Bag-of-Keys Returns at Module Boundaries"):

```ts
interface SurfaceState {
  url: string;
  editorReady: boolean;
  loginLike: boolean;
}

function parseSurfaceState(value: unknown): SurfaceState {
  const object = typeof value === 'object' && value !== null
    ? (value as Record<string, unknown>) : {};
  return {
    url: typeof object.url === 'string' ? object.url : '',
    editorReady: Boolean(object.editorFound),
    loginLike: Boolean(object.loginLike)
  };
}
```

Runtime coercion is still required for external input (the compiler cannot
verify data crossing the process boundary) — but the return type is declared,
so consumers are statically checked.

---

## Enums

Prefer union-of-literals or `as const` objects over `enum` (no runtime
surprises, erasable, better inference):

```ts
export const ERROR_CODE = {
  INPUT_INVALID: 'INPUT_INVALID',
  NETWORK_ERROR: 'NETWORK_ERROR',
  UNKNOWN: 'UNKNOWN'
} as const;

export type ErrorCode = (typeof ERROR_CODE)[keyof typeof ERROR_CODE];
```

Exhaustive `switch` over such unions must end with a `never` check so a new
member cannot be silently unhandled.

---

## Imports & Config Objects

- Type-only imports use `import type { … }` (enforced by
  `verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- Config/constant objects that must match an interface use `satisfies` so the
  literal keeps its narrow inferred type while still being checked:

```ts
const defaults = {
  timeoutSeconds: 120,
  format: 'json'
} satisfies AskOptions;
```

---

## Logging

Central logger per the COMMON_RULES logger table: `logger` export in
`logger.ts`. Same single-off-switch rule as the JS conventions.

---

## Testing

The test runner and file layout come from the runtime file. Typed seams apply
either way: the `__setXxxDepsForTest(deps)` parameter is a
`Partial<XxxDeps>` interface, so tests get completion and the seam cannot drift
from the real dependencies.

# Version
1

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# TypeScript pnpm Workspace Rules (Node, vitest)

See `COMMON_RULES.md` and `TYPESCRIPT_RULES.md`.

## Workspace Layout

- Define `apps/*` and `packages/*` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Keep the root `package.json` `private`, declare `packageManager` and `engines.node`, and put only workspace-wide fan-out scripts there (for example, `pnpm -r build`, `pnpm -r test`, and `pnpm -r typecheck`).
- Use ESM with `"type": "module"`. Node is the runtime; do not use Bun APIs.

## TypeScript Configuration

- Keep one strict `tsconfig.base.json` at the root with the compiler options in `TYPESCRIPT_RULES.md`.
- Every package has a `tsconfig.json` that extends the base and sets only package-specific `types`, `paths`, `include`, and `outDir`.
- Path aliases belong to the package that owns them. They must resolve the same way in the bundler (Vite `resolve.alias`) and in vitest; define them once and derive the other configuration, or keep both definitions together.
- Set `types` for each package's runtime and environment as described in `TYPESCRIPT_RULES.md`; do not mix Node and DOM types in one package.

## Package Boundaries

- Apps depend on workspace packages through `workspace:*` dependencies. Packages never import from `apps/*`.
- Cross-package imports use the package name and its `exports`; never reach into another package's `src/` with relative paths.
- Keep packages free of dependency cycles. Move shared code into a package rather than copying it between apps, following the DRY rule in `COMMON_RULES.md`.

## Testing with vitest

- Place `*.test.ts` and `*.test.tsx` next to their source or in the package's `tests/` directory. Each package runs its own `vitest run` script.
- Set DOM tests to a `jsdom` or `happy-dom` environment in that package's vitest config. Node packages use the Node environment.
- Use typed dependency injection seams as described in `TYPESCRIPT_RULES.md`.
- `tools/run_tests.bat` runs unit suites with per-test progress, such as `pnpm -r --workspace-concurrency=1 test -- --reporter=verbose`. `tools/run_integration_tests.bat` runs integration suites. Both scripts follow COMMON_RULES.md's “Test Runner Scripts”: stream progress and return the runner's exit code.

## Errors and Logging

- Each app has one top-level error handler, following `COMMON_RULES.md` -> “Error Handling”: a React error boundary in each renderer or SPA, and `process` handlers in the Node server and Electron main process.
- Use one `logger.ts` per the COMMON_RULES.md logger table. Put it in a shared package when several apps use it.

## Linting and Type Checking

- Keep an ESLint flat config with typescript-eslint at the workspace root.
- Give every package a `typecheck` script that runs `tsc --noEmit`.
- Follow COMMON_RULES.md -> “Confirm Dependency Versions” when adding a package.

# Version
1

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# Electron Rules (TypeScript)

Pair with `TYPESCRIPT_RULES.md`, `typescript/PNPM_WORKSPACE.md`, and
`project_type/FRONTEND.md`.

## Process Boundaries

Keep Electron's three entry points separate:

- `main/` runs in Node and owns windows, operating-system access, and IPC handlers.
- `preload/` exposes the narrow bridge between the main process and the renderer.
- `renderer/` runs in the browser and usually contains the shared web UI.

Renderer code must never import Node or Electron modules. Keep Node-only types
out of its TypeScript configuration, and share UI code with the web app through
workspace packages rather than reaching into app source folders.

## Secure Windows

Create each `BrowserWindow` with these settings:

```ts
webPreferences: {
  contextIsolation: true,
  nodeIntegration: false,
  sandbox: true,
  preload: preloadPath,
}
```

Never load remote content into a window that has a preload script. Keep the
preload small and expose only the operations the renderer needs.

## Typed Preload Bridge

Expose one typed API with `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld`. Put its interface
in a shared module imported by both the preload and renderer so the bridge
contract has one source of truth. Do not expose Node objects, Electron modules,
or unrestricted filesystem access.

Keep IPC channel names in that shared module as `as const` constants, following
COMMON_RULES.md -> “String Constants”:

```ts
export const IPC_CHANNEL = {
  READ_PROJECT: 'project:read',
} as const;
```

Expose named, typed API methods that use the approved channels. Do not provide a
generic bridge such as `invoke(channel, ...args)` that lets renderer code call
any channel.

## Validate IPC at the Main Boundary

Treat every IPC argument as `unknown` in the main process. Validate its shape
and values before using it, following COMMON_RULES.md -> “Input Validation at
Boundaries”. Types shared with the renderer do not validate data at runtime.
Reject invalid input with a clear error and never trust a renderer-provided
filesystem path, URL, or identifier without checking it against the operation's
allowed values.

## Packaged Renderer Assets

The packaged renderer loads assets from files. Set the desktop build's Vite
base to `./`; a web build may use `/`. Follow `project_type/FRONTEND.md` ->
“Base Path” to select the base per build target without hard-coding a deployment
subpath.

# Version

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# Frontend SPA Rules

These rules apply to all frontend single-page application projects, regardless of framework.
See `COMMON_RULES.md` for rules that apply to all languages.

---

## Build Tooling

Use Vite as the build tool with ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json).

### Base Path

Use `base: './'` by default for relative asset paths. One app built for several targets (for example, a desktop shell loading from `file://` and a web build served from `/`) may choose the base per build target in `vite.config`, using one build flag:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  base: isDesktop ? './' : '/',
});
```

Never hard-code a deployment subpath.

### Dev Server Proxy

Proxy API requests to the backend during development to avoid CORS issues:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost/your-backend-api',
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

---

## Styling

Use Tailwind CSS with PostCSS and Autoprefixer.

### Dark Mode

Use OS-aware dark mode via the `media` strategy by default when the app has no theme switch. When the app has a user-facing theme toggle, use a class or attribute strategy instead. Start from `prefers-color-scheme` until the user chooses, store the choice, and set the class or attribute before first paint to avoid a flash:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  darkMode: ['class', '[data-theme="dark"]'],
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{svelte,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
};
```

### Global Styles

Import Tailwind layers in a single global CSS file:

```css
/* src/app.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### PostCSS

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

### SCSS/Sass (Optional)

SCSS can be used alongside Tailwind for complex component styles, or as the sole styling approach.
See `SCSS_RULES.md` for detailed rules on file organization, naming, mixins, and dark mode.

Install as a dev dependency — Vite compiles SCSS automatically:

```bash
npm install -D sass
```

---

## API Client

Create a centralized API client module (`src/lib/api.js`) instead of scattering `fetch()` calls across components.

### Pattern

Two core helpers — `request()` for raw responses, `json()` for parsed JSON:

```javascript
import { API_BASE_URL } from '../config.js';

async function request(path, options = {}) {
  const url = API_BASE_URL + path;
  const headers = { ...getAuthHeader(), ...options.headers };
  const res = await fetch(url, { ...options, headers });

  if (res.status === 401) {
    authStore.logout();
    window.location.hash = '#/login';
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  }

  return res;
}

async function json(path, options = {}) {
  const res = await request(path, options);
  if (!res.ok) {
    const body = await res.json().catch(() => ({ error: res.statusText }));
    throw new Error(body.error || res.statusText);
  }
  return res.json();
}
```

### Exported Functions

Export named functions for each API operation. Keep function signatures simple:

```javascript
export function getEntries(limit = 50, offset = 0, filters = {}) {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ limit, offset });
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(filters)) {
    if (value != null && value !== '') params.set(key, value);
  }
  return json(`/entries?${params}`);
}

export function deleteEntry(id) {
  return json(`/entries/${id}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
}
```

### One Call per Page (BINDING)

- Load all initial API data for a page or route's visible content with **one call**. Use an
  existing list or detail operation when it is sufficient; use a screen overview endpoint when
  the page needs several datasets.
- Never call a detail endpoint for each item in a list (N+1), or fetch several lists to join or
  count them in the browser.
- Extra calls are allowed when the user opens a detail, requests the next page, searches, changes
  a filter, performs a mutation, or opens a previously hidden tab whose content is loaded lazily.
- Lists are read page by page and sorted, filtered and searched by the API; see
  `COMMON_RULES.md` -> "API Clients: the API Sorts, Filters and Pages".
- If the API lacks the required overview endpoint or a sort, filter or paging parameter, request
  it from the API project with `/feedback:write` or a linked todo instead of fanning out calls.
  The server rule is
  `project_type/REST_API.md` -> "Screen Overview Endpoints".

---

## Configuration

### Build-Time Environment Variables

Use the build tool's environment variable system (e.g., `import.meta.env` with Vite). Prefix variables with the required prefix (`VITE_` for Vite).

### Runtime Config Module

Create a single `config.js` that reads environment variables and provides defaults:

```javascript
// src/config.js
export const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || '/api';
```

### Environment Files

- `.env` — local overrides (gitignored)
- `.env.example` — template with placeholder values (committed)

---

## Authentication Pattern

### Flow

1. On app mount, check backend auth method (`GET /auth`)
2. If `method: 'none'` → auto-login as anonymous
3. Otherwise → redirect to login page
4. On login → store credentials in `sessionStorage`
5. All API requests inject `Authorization` header from store
6. On 401 response → clear auth, redirect to login
7. On logout → clear `sessionStorage`

### Why sessionStorage

Use `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) for auth credentials:
- Cleared when the browser tab closes
- Not shared across tabs (prevents accidental credential leakage)
- Auto-cleared on 401 from the API client

---

## Release System

### Version Management

Store the version in `package.json`. Use batch scripts in `tools/` for version management:

- `tools/version.bat` — display current version
- `tools/version-increment.bat` — increment patch version
- `tools/version-decrement.bat` — decrement patch version

### Release Notes

Store release notes as JSON files in `public/release_notes/`:

```
public/release_notes/
├── manifest.json              # Auto-generated, lists all versions newest-first
├── 1.0.0/
│   └── en.json
└── 1.0.1/
    └── en.json
```

#### Release Note Schema (`en.json`)

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "date": "2026-03-01",
  "title": "Bug Fixes",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Bug Fixes",
      "items": [
        "Fixed issue with file upload validation"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Manifest (`manifest.json`)

Auto-generated by a Node.js script that scans version directories:

```json
{
  "versions": ["1.0.1", "1.0.0"]
}
```

Regenerate with: `node tools/update-manifest.js`

### Automated Release

`tools/release.bat` runs the full workflow:
1. Increment patch version
2. Check/create release notes for new version
3. Regenerate manifest.json
4. Run production build

### In-App About Page

The app fetches `manifest.json` at runtime and displays release notes with prev/next navigation. No hardcoded versions — fully dynamic.

---

## Required Batch Files

Every frontend SPA project must include these in `tools/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tools/install.bat` | Install dependencies (`npm install`) |
| `tools/run.bat` | Start development server (`npm run dev`) |
| `tools/build.bat` | Production build (`npm run build`) |
| `tools/release.bat` | Full release workflow (version + notes + build) |

---

## API Testing Collection

Include a Hoppscotch (or similar) API collection for testing backend endpoints:

```
hoppscotch/
├── CLAUDE.md        # Instructions for using the collection
└── example.json     # Exported collection file
```

This helps onboarding and debugging API integration.

# Version

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# Design Rules (All Languages)

See `COMMON_RULES.md` for rules that apply to all languages. These rules apply to
anything with a user interface — desktop app, web frontend, mobile app, CLI TUI.

They are about **decisions**, not about a framework. The per-stack implementation
guides are:

- `python_setup_files/MODERN_GUI.md` — PySide6 desktop apps
- `project_type/FRONTEND.md` — web SPAs (Vite, Tailwind, dark mode)
- `project_type/SERVER_RENDERED_FRONTEND.md` — server-rendered PHP web frontends (Twig, Bootstrap)

Default UI toolkits ship a *safe* look, not a good one: gradient buttons, boxed tabs,
every control the same size, no hierarchy. An interface built from defaults reads as a
debug tool no matter how good the code behind it is.

---

## Tokens, Not Values

Every color, spacing step, radius, and font size is a **named token defined once**.
Call sites reference the token; nothing hardcodes `#2B2B2B` or `13px`.

- **Anti-pattern.** A hex color appears on four screens. Changing the theme means
  finding all four, and the one you miss is the one the user sees.
- **Correct pattern.** One palette/theme module (a frozen dataclass, a CSS custom
  property block, a `ThemeData`) that every screen reads.
- This is "String Constants" and DRY applied to design. The moment a value appears
  twice, it is a token.

---

## One Accent Color

Pick **one** accent and use it only for: the selected navigation item, the focus ring,
the primary action, and progress. Everything else is a neutral.

- An interface where the accent frames the window, fills the title bar, and outlines
  every button has no accent — it has a background color.
- Semantic colors (success green, error red) are separate tokens and do **not** follow
  the accent. If a status color must match another app or a spec, comment the field
  saying so, so a theme change does not silently redefine it.
- Never encode information in color alone — pair it with a glyph, a label, or a
  position (colorblind users, grayscale printing, low-quality projectors).

---

## Neutral Ramp Before Color

A dark theme needs at least: window background, an elevated surface, a control fill,
its hover and pressed states, a border, primary text, and muted text. Most of a good
interface is that ramp; color is the exception on top of it.

Body text on the background must clear **4.5:1** contrast (3:1 for large text and for
UI borders that carry meaning). Muted text is muted, not unreadable — check it, don't
eyeball it.

---

## Hierarchy Is Type and Space, Not Boxes

Three levels are usually enough: a page heading, a muted one-line explanation, and body
or control text. Give each a token (size + weight), and build them with a **shared
factory** (`heading()` / `subheading()`), never by repeating the styling on each screen.

- Separate groups with whitespace before you separate them with a border, and with a
  border before you separate them with a filled box.
- A screen that is all boxes has no hierarchy — everything is equally important, which
  means nothing is.
- Use a consistent spacing scale (4/8/12/16/24…) rather than whatever number closed the
  gap on that one screen.

---

## Size Controls by Importance

Controls should not all be the same size, and the primary action should not be the same
weight as its neighbors. A grid of six identical giant buttons is as flat as a grid of
six identical tiny ones.

- Primary action: filled, accent.
- Secondary: outlined or flat with accent text.
- Rare actions (a custom value, an advanced group): folded away behind a toggle or a
  collapsed section — present, not prominent.

---

## Every Focusable Control Has a Visible Focus State

The moment you give a control a custom background, the toolkit's own focus ring
disappears. Re-add it explicitly, in the accent, on **every** focusable control —
buttons, fields, lists, tabs.

Keyboard users, accessibility tooling, and your own automated tests all navigate by
focus. This is not decoration; a UI with an invisible focus ring is unusable without a
mouse. Tab through the entire interface once before calling a restyle done.

---

## Never Set a Minimum Size to Fix a Layout

If content is too tall or too wide, make it **scroll or wrap** — do not pin the window.
A minimum size set to fix one screen becomes a floor every other screen inherits,
including screens the user is not looking at (tab and stack containers report their
largest child's minimum as their own).

- Wrap every page/route in a scrolling container.
- Word-wrap explanatory text; an unwrapped sentence sets the width floor.
- Then pin it with a test: assert the window resizes to something tiny, and assert the
  stylesheet contains no minimum-size rule.

---

## Own the Window Chrome

On desktop, the title bar and window frame belong to the OS and default to the user's
system accent color. A carefully themed dark app with a bright green caption bar looks
broken. Set the caption and border explicitly, and make the call a **silent no-op** on
platforms and OS versions that do not support it.

---

## Icons: Vendor a Subset, Recolor in Code

- Vendor the SVGs you actually use into the repo, with the upstream `LICENSE` and a
  header naming the set and version. Never fetch icon assets at runtime, and never add
  a whole icon-font dependency for six glyphs.
- Recolor from a palette token in code rather than committing one file per color.
- Cache by `(name, color)`.
- Keep icon sizes on the same scale as the type — an icon that is not aligned to the
  text baseline or optical center reads as a mistake.

---

## Design the Empty, Loading, and Error States

Every list has a first run. Every request fails sometimes. A screen designed only for
the happy path ships a blank rectangle to every new user.

- **Empty**: say what would be here and how to get one.
- **Loading**: keep the layout stable — never let content jump when it arrives.
- **Error**: say what failed and what to do next, in the interface, not only in a log.
- **Validation**: show it where the input is, not in a dialog. If the user can see the
  field, tell them there instead of silently falling back to a default.

---

## Follow the Platform, Then Be Consistent

Match the platform's conventions for window controls, menus, shortcuts, and dialogs
before inventing your own. Inside your app, be *ruthlessly* consistent: the same action
looks the same everywhere, the same spacing separates the same kinds of things, the
same word means the same thing on every screen.

If two of your own screens disagree, the screens are wrong — not the user.

---

## Localize From the Start

Every user-visible string goes through the translation layer with a key constant, never
a raw string at a call site. Layouts must survive a translation that is 40% longer:
wrap text, avoid fixed-width labels, and never build a sentence by concatenating
fragments — translate the whole sentence with placeholders.

---

## Verify Visually, and Automate It

A restyle is not done because the tests pass — tests do not look at the screen.

- Render each screen to an image (offscreen/headless is fine and deterministic) and
  actually look at all of them after a change.
- Check the app at its smallest supported size, not just the size it opens at.
- Automate what an image cannot assert: no minimum-size rule in the theme, a focus style
  on every control, a recolored icon that still has pixels.
- Never drive a real window with synthetic mouse clicks to capture screenshots — the
  moment focus moves, those clicks land in someone else's application.

---

# graphify Knowledge Graph (Optional Addon)

graphify turns a code folder into a queryable knowledge graph — god nodes, communities,
cross-file relationships, fan-in/fan-out. Use it to orient before grep and to spot god classes.

**Keep the build AST-only (no LLM, no API cost) by scoping to the code dir.** graphify runs a
free deterministic AST pass on *code* files, but a separate **LLM pass** on every *non-code*
file — docs, `.md`, `.txt`, config `.yaml`, images (vision), audio/video (whisper). That pass
needs an LLM (Gemini key or the host agent) and costs tokens. A build scoped to a pure-code dir
(`lib/`, `src/`, `app/`) has zero non-code files, so it skips the LLM pass entirely and rebuilds
need no AI. A repo-root build (`/graphify .`) sweeps in `docs/`, `README.md`, icons, and sound
assets — forcing the LLM pass. **Always scope to the code dir; never build the repo root.**

---

Setup instructions live in the coding-rules plugin at `graphify_setup_files/SETUP.md`.

## What the graph knows (and does not)

- Knows: code structure — classes, methods, calls, references, extends/implements, plus
  fan-in/fan-out and community / god-node structure.
- Does NOT know: business rules, API response shape, or rendered template/view output. It is a
  snapshot — stale until rebuilt. Constants referenced by string can appear as isolated nodes
  (AST limitation, not a missing dependency).

---

## Using the graph

- For codebase questions, run `graphify query "<question>"` first when `graphify-out/graph.json`
  exists. `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships; `graphify explain "<concept>"` for a
  focused node. These return a small scoped subgraph vs. reading GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep.
- Judge coupling by direction: high **fan-in** + low fan-out (shared base / constants / DTO) is
  healthy; high **fan-out** (>~20 outgoing deps) is god-class risk and a refactor signal.
- Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for broad architecture review, or when
  query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
